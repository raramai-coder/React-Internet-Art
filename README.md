# Welcome to the React-Internet-Art repository! 
This [internet art website](https://raramai-coder.github.io/React-Internet-Art/) is a thought-provoking internet art piece built with React that explores the intersection of AI-generated content and human creativity, with a specific focus on queer African art. Below, you'll find an overview of the project, setup instructions, usage details, and ways to contribute.

## Project Overview
React-Internet-Art is an interactive web-based artwork designed to address critical questions surrounding AI-generated art and content. The intention is to create a deceptive yet revealing user experience: at first glance, the website appears to be a curator’s platform showcasing queer African art. However, all displayed images (currently placeholders like white circles and blocks) will be replaced with content generated by an AI algorithm using OpenAI. Upon closer inspection, users will realize that the artwork is entirely AI-created.

This project aims to provoke thought about how we classify and label art based on conventions and expectations. For instance, terms like "futuristic art" or "classical art" evoke specific mental images shaped by historical data and cultural norms. AI exploits these conventions by generating content that fits neatly into predefined criteria, raising questions about authenticity and creativity.

While the project does not take a stance on whether such rigid conventions are good or bad, it highlights a key distinction with queer African art. Unlike a genre or style defined by visual conventions, queer African art is a categorization based on the identity of the creators, encompassing a broad and diverse range of expressions. To emphasize this diversity, the website includes an "Artists" page where users can engage with real art created by actual queer African artists, contrasting it with AI-generated imitations.

At its core, this artwork underscores a fundamental difference: AI cannot be truly creative. It can only remix and regurgitate existing patterns, lacking the human ability to imagine, challenge conventions, and create outside the box. In a neoliberal capitalist world where corporations may increasingly rely on AI to mimic human art styles without compensating artists, this project asserts the irreplaceable value of human creativity. As a popular TikTok meme sound puts it, “you can’t beat the original.”

*Note: This project is osted for free on Github, as a result API keys for the OPENAI API used for artgeneration could not be publicly shared, hence the image generation section of the site is not functional on the hosted version of the site.*
