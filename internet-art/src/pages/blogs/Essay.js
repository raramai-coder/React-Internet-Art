				<h4>Introduction</h4>
				<div className="header-bars"></div>
				<p>
					In this essay I will be critically analysing the internet artwork by
					activist Aaron Swartz and artist Taryn Simon titled Image Atlas.
					Taking a specific look at how it illuminates the realities of internet
					search engines and brings to forefront the different contexts of the
					social process of information gathering on the internet. And how it
					challenges our assumptions about information on the internet and
					precisely how it does a good job of the above by using the internet as
					medium. Furthermore, I will discuss why this artwork in particular
					interests me as well as briefly discuss some of the interesting
					ethical questions about the internet that I believe the artwork
					raises.
				</p>

				<h4>Description of Artwork</h4>
				<div className="header-bars"></div>
				<p>
					Image Atlas is a 2012 interactive internet artwork which aims to
					investigate the differences and similarities of search engine results
					in different countries across the globe (NET ART ANTHOLOGY: Image
					Atlas, 2016). The user is able to interact with the artwork by
					entering a search term into the website and then the top five image
					results from various countries are displayed. The user is also able to
					select which countries should be displayed in the results as well as
					whether the countries should be ordered alphabetically or by GDP.
				</p>
				<p>
					The artwork can be viewed online at
					<a href="http://www.imageatlas.org/ ">http://www.imageatlas.org/ </a>
				</p>

				<h4>Image Atlas as Internet Art</h4>
				<div className="header-bars"></div>
				<p>
					Whilst there is no strict set of criteria or definition for what
					constitutes an internet artwork (www.artsy.net, 2016) Image Atlas
					checks two broad ideas of what I would argue can be considered
					internet art. For starters it is an artwork that requires the internet
					to be experienced. It is solely distributed on the web and requires an
					internet connection, otherwise the search results will not be
					displayed. One might argue that the artists could have chosen specific
					terms, searched for them and compiled the images from different
					countries and printed them out onto analogue media (like a poster or a
					canvas) and displayed the artwork in a gallery as a static
					(non-interactive) work. But I later argue that this would have removed
					the core meaning and impact of the artwork. And hence exhibiting it on
					the internet was necessary.
				</p>

				<p>
					Secondly, the artwork derives its meaning from the internet and our
					procedural use of it. Without the existence of internet search
					engines, the artwork would not exist.
				</p>

				<p>
					So, in its form (medium and distribution) and its meaning Image Atlas
					is intertwined with the internet. This entanglement that it has with
					internet is what gives me the confidence to definitively state that it
					is an internet artwork.
				</p>

				<h4>Social Process</h4>
				<div className="header-bars"></div>
				<p>
					Society is a set of intricate social connections, behaviours, and
					relationships. The ways in which individuals and groups interact with
					each other to form, solidify, and express these social relationships
					are called social processes. Social processes help to develop and
					maintain the social system. (tyonote.com, 2021., Samishka, 2013.)
					Examples of social processes include integration, globalization,
					assimilation etc. (Samishka, 2013).
				</p>

				<p>
					An important aspect of any social process is the context through which
					it is formed, this context is informed to the individual through the
					information that is available to them. Hence information gathering is
					an important aspect of social processes, as the type of information
					acquired, both in terms of content and quantity, affects the kinds of
					social processes an individual can partake in.
				</p>

				<p>
					Furthermore, the act of information gathering can itself be a social
					process when it includes the interaction between one individual with
					another. This is obvious in the state of a conversation between two
					people, or a lecture presented by a lecturer to their students. On the
					internet however, the second party to the information gathering is
					abstracted and mostly invisible. But we know that all information on
					the internet is created by human beings (regardless of what AI wants
					you to think). Hence information gathering is a social process exacted
					by the content producer and the consumer.
				</p>
				<p>
					The internet, which has largely proliferated various social aspects of
					our lives, facilitates certain social processes (Buonomo et al.,
					2015). More specifically for our purpose is the aspect of information
					gathering. The internet has for many become the leading source of
					information, not just of the academic kind, but information on more
					complex parts of life, like social systems, economic structures,
					behavioural psychology, the list is practically endless (Buonomo et
					al., 2015).
				</p>

				<h4>Image Atlas and Social Process</h4>
				<div className="header-bars"></div>
				<p>
					The social process of information gathering on the internet affects
					for example, what an individual will view as the status quo (Huizer et
					al., 2017). We know that the kind of information available to a person
					affects the social processes they will partake in and the kinds of
					opinions they will hold. And Image Atlas does a great job is
					showcasing how this information is not universally alike or neutral.
				</p>

				<h4>Challenging social processes</h4>
				<div className="header-bars"></div>
				<p>
					The power in the artwork lies in how it takes a behaviour that the
					average internet user partakes in regularly and adds a new layer of
					context to it. Most internet users will be familiar with the concept
					of inputting a term into a search engine and getting results in
					return. But what they will most probably not be actively conscious of,
					is how their physical location (or rather their IP address) affects
					the results they receive.
				</p>

				<p>
					It challenges an assumption most users have of the internet of its
					neutrality and how access to information is unbiased. In recreating
					behavioural patterns we frequently engage in and placing them in a new
					context, the art work challenges our notions of how information
					gathering works on the internet. Showing that it is neither neutral
					nor unaffected by real world circumstances.
				</p>

				<h4>Information Economy</h4>
				<div className="header-bars"></div>
				<p>
					Whilst the artwork focuses primarily on images, the message it
					illuminates and the questions it raises can be applied to search
					results that are not necessarily visual in format, so this includes
					webpages, research papers, blogs, social media accounts etc.
				</p>

				<p>
					This effect has greater impact when one takes into account that as a
					global society we are making the move from industrialisation to the
					information economy (Cole, 2019). And the internet is at the core of
					this transformation, both in information gathering and information
					production.
				</p>

				<p>
					So the artwork puts in the limelight this thing that is so central to
					not only our economic progression, but central aspects of our lives
					and social processes. Which raises a lot of interesting questions.
				</p>

				<h4>Ethics</h4>
				<div className="header-bars"></div>

				<p>
					At the core of the many questions raised, is one of access to
					information. There is on one hand the question of whether it is
					morally good for people in different parts of the world to access
					different information when they search for the same thing. We know
					that there exists a digital divide among not only nations but
					individuals within nations, and is this divide not exacerbated by
					having access to vastly different information? Furthermore, if we are
					to try and bridge this gap, should we all not be coming from the same
					page?
				</p>

				<p>
					For example, search results in Iran vary greatly from those in
					America, can there be a closing of the mental distance between these
					two nations if the information they ingest from the internet is so
					different?
				</p>
				<p>
					On the other hand, there is the question of whether the information
					shown to people in different parts of the world should be the same.
					What about localisation and context. We know the information
					generation on the internet has been asymmetrically swayed towards the
					West, which means that very little local information is produced and
					available for those not in the West (Huizer et al., 2017).
				</p>
				<p>
					But should the search results for example for best crop rotation
					methods be the same for someone living in South Africa versus someone
					living in America? Surely context should take precedence here.
				</p>
				<p>
					Moreover, the domination of the West in terms of pedagogy and
					knowledge over its colonised subjects can and may be re-established
					when the rest of the world are fed information that is created,
					relevant to and of importance to the West and not location specific to
					the searcher.
				</p>

				<h4>Why it inspires me</h4>
				<div className="header-bars"></div>

				<p>
					The artwork does not try to answer the ethical questions posed above,
					but it does a good job in raising them. Giving the user the
					opportunity to ponder for themselves the implications of this
					informational difference or similarity on the internet.
				</p>
				<p>
					It uses the internet, the object of its contemplation, in its
					execution and exhibition. There is a greater impact on the user when
					they get to select the search terms and see the results for themselves
					instead of having a static list of searched terms and displaying the
					result. This method takes the behavioural pattern and social process
					performed and illuminates its nature in order to bring about new ways
					of thinking about it.
				</p>
				<p>
					It does all this in a way that is fun and interactive, whilst also
					being timeless because as search engines evolve and show new results
					this artwork will be up to date with it.
				</p>
				<p>
					My aspirations with my own internet artworks would be to create
					something that is fun and interactive, but at the same time raises
					important social ethical questions without the need to answer them for
					the viewer of the artwork. Doing something similar in nature to Image
					Atlas.
				</p>
				<p>
					Furthermore, the artwork utilises the internet as a medium not in an
					incidental way but in a necessary and crucial way, ensuring that no
					doubt could be left about whether or not this artwork needed to be on
					the internet.
				</p>

				<h4>Conclusion</h4>
				<div className="header-bars"></div>
				<p>
					The artwork Image Atlas uses the internet as medium, for both its
					exhibition and content. Entangling itself with the internet in such
					way that displays effective use of the medium. Finally it highlights
					certain looked over aspects of the social process of information
					gathering (in this emerging information economy) on the internet.
					Raising important social ethical questions whilst remaining a fun and
					engaging artwork.
